# Learning C and C++

Learning to program in C and C ++

## Description

I made simple games in C and C ++ to learn to use the commands, libraries and functions of the C and C ++ programming language.

## Description
to compile the games, go to the folder in the terminal and write gcc filename.c -o nomedese.exe (windows) or .out (linux / macOs) 

## Cloning the Repository
With Git and Node.js installed on your machine, choose location and clone repository, use this commands:

```
git https://github.com/Drete457/learning_c_and_c_plus_plus.git
cd learning_c_and_c_plus_plus
Choose a folder C or C++ then the game inside.

If you choose folder C, use this command to compile:
gcc filename.c -o nomedese.exe (windows) or .out (linux / macOs)

if you choose folder C++, use this command to copile:
g++ filename.c -o nomedese.exe (windows) or .out (linux / macOs)

(don't forget to have gcc installed)
```
